#+title: SABnzbd Role
#+author: Chris Wolf <chris@chriswolf.ch>

This is a simple ansible role that installs SABnzbd.

** How it works
There are only two tasks in this role.

In a first step, the PPA repository is added and in a second one, the =sabnzbd= package gets installed.

** Limitations
This role only works on debian based systems as the package is installed with the PPA repo.

** Configuration
There is no configuration for this role.
